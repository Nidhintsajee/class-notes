TCP/IP Networking
=================
a) What is TCP/IP?

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the basic communication language or protocol of the Internet. It can also be 

used as a communications protocol in a private network (either an intranet or an extranet).

b) What is protocol?

The TCP/IP Internet protocols, a common example, consist of: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which uses a set of rules to exchange 

messages with other Internet points at the information packet level. Internet Protocol (IP), which uses a set of rules to send and receive 

messages at the Internet address level. Gateways/router is coonection between client and server.

traceroute : It is a command which can show you the path a packet of information takes from your computer to one you specify. It will list 

all the routers it passes through until it reaches its destination, or fails to and is discarded. In addition to this, it will tell you how 

long each 'hop' from router to router takes.

$ traceroute gnu.org

long list. we got ip address, very complex job from client to destination.

c) Protocol is basically some kind of code which manages data transfer from a .

d) You can actually see the code of network in kernel, it is the part of os kernel.

kernel.org - we can download various versions. "Linux kernel cross refernce" we can see codes by web pages in c code.

e) What is an Ip address?

An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer 

network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface 

identification and location addressing.The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is a protocol for use on packet-switched Link Layer networks 

(e.g. Ethernet). IPv4 provides an addressing capability of approximately 4.3 billion addresses. The Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is 

more advanced and has better features compared to IPv4.

The following table lists the important differences between IPv4 and IPv6.

		IPv4						IPv6	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*IPv4 addresses are 32 bit length.		*IPv6 addresses are 128 bit length.

*IPv4 addresses are binary numbers 
represented in decimals.			*IPv6 addresses are binary numbers represented in hexadecimals.

*IPSec support is only optional.		*Inbuilt IPSec support.

*Fragmentation is done by sender and 
forwarding routers.				*Fragmentation is done only by sender.

*No packet flow identification.			*Packet flow identification is available within the IPv6 header using 
						 the Flow Label field.

*Checksum field is available in IPv4 header	*No checksum field in IPv6 header.

*Options fields are available in IPv4 header.	*No option fields, but IPv6 Extension headers are available.

*Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is available
 to map IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses.	*Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is replaced with a function of 
						 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).
*Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is
 used to manage multicast group membership.	*IGMP is replaced with Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) messages.

*Broadcast messages are available.		*Broadcast messages are not available. Instead a link-local scope "All nodes" 
						 multicast IPv6 address (FF02::1) is used for broadcast similar functionality.
*Manual configuration (Static) of IPv4 
addresses or DHCP (Dynamic configuration) is 
required to configure IPv4 addresses.		*Auto-configuration of addresses is available.

f) client/server

A--B, Client ->which starts communicate first
 
g)Client has to know the address of server at very beggining itself.

h)IP address identifies a machine, programs running machines.

i)How do you identify one particular program

"port numbers"(integer values)
