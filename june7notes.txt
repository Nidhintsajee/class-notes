Time complexity -> Relate the running time of your program with the size of the input.

Big O notation, time complexity O(n). Time taken is proportional to N.

Memory management in C program
------------------------------
p=malloc(100) -> allocate memory

free(p) -> free memory

C program manages memory by calling malloc and free.

C pgm1:

#include <stdlib.h>
#define LEN 10000

void fun()
{
    char *p;

    p = malloc(LEN);
    
    if(p == 0) {
        perror("malloc failed");
        exit(1);
    }

    free(p);/*here function free is called for freeing memory,to avoid memory leak*/
}

main()
{
    /* call "fun" in an infinite loop */

    while(1) {
        fun();
    }

    
}
C pgm2:

#include <stdlib.h>
#define LEN 10000

void fun()
{
    char *p;

    p = malloc(LEN);
    if(p == 0) {
        perror("malloc failed");
        exit(1);
    }
/*here free call is missing,so here memory leak occured.eatup all available memory*/
}

main()
{
    while(1) {
        fun();
        usleep(10); /* slow down the loop a little bit */
    }

    
}
C program is manual memory management, explicitly allocate and deallocate memory.

memory allocate and forget to free and call free functon more than once are the 2 situations bugs were occured.

python, java, perl, ruby, lisp are automatic memory management.
