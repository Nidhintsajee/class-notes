disk data layout
----------------
inode is a disk data structure which holds all information regarding a file except it's name. size of the

file, date/time, ownership, permissions..

a Directory
-----------
a disk data structure.which contains a list of files and inode numbers.

disk: inode table :array of inodes/ sequence of inodes

an inode number is simply an index into this array. it helps you to identify one particular inode.

a)a.c ->12678

b)indexes the inode table with this number and idntifies a unique "inode".

c)inode tools: th address of data blocks of the file.

d)os can access the blocks and read/write data.

when we copy a file using cp command inode changes, because it create new file.

but using ln(link) command inode does'nt changes, it only create a refernce.

when you create ln you are simply creating a new directory entry. 

no data is copied. no change when moving/rename inode.

grep :egrep, fgrep, egrep : extended grep

daemon -> running in background. cron- shedule.

pid -> process id

pid 1 -> init
