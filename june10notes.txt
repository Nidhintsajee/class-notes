ssh -> for remote logging

find /-name filename -> search for file.

inode -> index node

disk -> size, date, permkissions, datablock addresses except filename.

when we copy a file using cp command inode changes, because it create new file.

but using ln(link) command inode does'nt changes, it only create a refernce.

when you create ln you are simply creating a new directory entry. 

no data is copied. no change when moving/rename inode.

grep :egrep, fgrep, egrep : extended grep

daemon -> running in background. cron- shedule.

pid -> process id

pid 1 -> init
