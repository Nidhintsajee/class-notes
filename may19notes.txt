nano,gedit->casual editing 
emacs->more complex
language of unix shell:
eg1:
	while true  
	do 
		 echo hello
	done            
eg2:	
	main()
	{
		return 10;  -->captuared by unix shell.
	}
value in return back from main exit status of program.
->shell interprets 0 as TRUE and 1 as FALSE.
while cmd->takes as a program, run that program.
successfully executed commands have exit status 0,other wise 1.
/dev/null-> it vanishes datas ideal location.
